**Course Title: Introduction to MIPS Processor Architecture**

---

### Slide 1: Introduction to MIPS Processors
- **Bullet Points:**
  - What is MIPS?
  - Importance in the history of computing.
  - Overview of today’s discussion.

- **Speaker’s Notes:**
  - Good day, everyone. Today, we're going to explore the MIPS processor architecture, a notable example of Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture. We'll discuss what MIPS is, its significance, and provide a brief overview of the concepts we'll be covering today, including RISC vs. CISC, datapath designs, and pipelining.

### Slide 2: What is MIPS?
- **Bullet Points:**
  - MIPS: Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages.
  - Designed by MIPS Technologies.
  - High-performance RISC architecture.

- **Speaker’s Notes:**
  - MIPS, which stands for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages, was designed by MIPS Technologies in the 1980s. It is renowned for its simplicity and efficiency, characteristics that typify RISC architectures. This design philosophy focuses on executing a series of small, highly optimized instructions.

### Slide 3: Understanding RISC and CISC
- **Bullet Points:**
  - RISC: Reduced Instruction Set Computer.
  - CISC: Complex Instruction Set Computer.
  - Key differences and impacts on processing.

- **Speaker’s Notes:**
  - RISC, or Reduced Instruction Set Computer, simplifies the processor design by using fewer, but more general-purpose instructions. Conversely, CISC, or Complex Instruction Set Computer, uses more complex instructions, potentially reducing software complexity but increasing hardware complexity. MIPS is a prime example of RISC design, emphasizing speed and efficiency.

### Slide 4: Single Cycle Datapath
- **Bullet Points:**
  - Definition of single cycle datapath.
  - Advantages and limitations.

- **Speaker’s Notes:**
  - In a single cycle datapath, every instruction completes in one clock cycle. While this simplifies timing and control, it can limit the clock speed since the cycle must be long enough to accommodate the slowest instruction. We'll explore how this affects processor performance.

### Slide 5: Multi Cycle Datapath
- **Bullet Points:**
  - Definition of multi cycle datapath.
  - How it differs from single cycle.

- **Speaker’s Notes:**
  - A multi cycle datapath breaks instructions into separate steps, each taking one cycle. This allows for shorter cycles and more efficient use of hardware, as different parts of the processor can be used at different times.

- **Suggested Table:** Steps of instruction in multi cycle datapath.

### Slide 6: Pipelining in MIPS
- **Bullet Points:**
  - Concept of pipelining.
  - How MIPS implements pipelining.
  - Advantages of pipelining.

- **Speaker’s Notes:**
  - Pipelining is a technique where multiple instructions are overlapped in execution. MIPS typically uses a five-stage pipeline: instruction fetch, instruction decode, execute, memory access, and register write-back. This increases instruction throughput and overall efficiency.

### Slide 7: General History of MIPS
- **Bullet Points:**
  - Development in the 1980s.
  - Influence on modern computing.
  - Current applications and legacy.

- **Speaker’s Notes:**
  - Developed in the 1980s by MIPS Technologies, the MIPS architecture has profoundly influenced modern computing, impacting everything from embedded systems to high-performance servers. Today, MIPS continues to be used widely, including in various applications that require efficient, compact instruction sets.
